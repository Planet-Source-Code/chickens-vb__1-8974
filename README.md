### Description

This is a VB version of a game I found on the internet somewhere. Very simply, a load of chickens run across the screen, you just click to shoot.

Did I mention that there are randomly generated, adjustable levels, where so select how bumpy they are, and wait for the fun to start (Though you'll be waiting along time =0) )

I've now put a picture here, so all you who wern't downloading this ace game can see what your missing, and increase the hit count for me.
 
### More Info
 
This game should return hours of mindless fun, when you know you should be working...

Side affects include a decrease in sympathy to fluffy things...
